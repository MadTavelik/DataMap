However, data provided by The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority point otherwise; at least when it comes to solar power. The data shows commercial and residential solar power projects in the state going back to the year 2000 and indicates a substantial lead in Suffolk County, NY, when compared to the rest of the state and some of its more liberal strongholds, such as NYC or Buffalo.</p>
