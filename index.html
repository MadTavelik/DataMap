            <p class="dash-line">Seagirt Blvd in The Rockaways has had a high rate of accidents, with a total of 232 total injuries along the entire corridor between 2015 and 2019 and 12 severe pedestrian injuries. There is a lack of crosswalks or Bike lanes on the 8-lane roadway with rampant automobile speeding and jaywalking. In 2019, a camera at the intersection of Seagirt Boulevard and Crest Road issued the most speed camera tickets in the city; according to the Department of Transportation last year, it handed out 18,289 tickets, or roughly 50 per day. In 2017 after a jogger suffered a fatality on the Blvd, Assemblywoman. Stacey Pheffer Amato representing the Rockaways in New Yorkâ€™s 23rd district, called on the NYC DOT to immediately make improvements to the Blvd.</p>

            <p class="dash-line">The intersection of Seagirt Boulevard and Beach 20th was declared a Vision Zero Priority after ten severe pedestrian injuries and two fatalities between 2014 and 2018. In April 2022, the NYC DOT released a project proposal for the Blvd, which included the installation of bike lanes, better crosswalks, and lane removals, among others.  They cited community outreach they did with an 83% community approval for the plan.  On September 1, 2022, the DOT announced via tweet that they would begin implementing the plan that month.</p>

            <p class="dash-line">The DOT Seagirt Blvd. project announcement was rejected by Queens Community Board 14 and denounced by Assemblywoman Amato as too heavy-handed and not enough feedback from the district.  Out of all residents in NYC, Queens CD 14 has the longest mean commute to work at 51.1 minutes, and the project's plan to remove a lane from both sides of the eight-lane blvd has commuters concerned that it will affect their commute time to and from the peninsula. In a statement from the NYC DOT in response to their community outreach for the project, they claimed to have gathered community input via its 2021/2022 community outreach campaign, including Community Board meetings and meeting with elected officials.</p>

            <p class="dash-line">The DOT has outlined multiple project stages to begin on October 15th. First, contractors typically complete the layout and installation of new markings after removing previous markings. Vertical elements, such as quick curb, flexible delineators, and rubber speed humps, will also be installed once markings are complete. Sign work and signal work will continue concurrently with markings improvements. Construction is expected to continue throughout Fall 2022.</p>
